I would like to express my deepest thanks to D\'aniel P\'asztor for his valuable support as a scientific advisor and ideas throughout the whole project. I am incredibly thankful to all the people who took the time to review this work out of their busy lives. In particular, I would like to thank Daniel Bened\'i Garc\'ia and Ant\'onio Elias for reviewing the chapters. I am infinitely grateful to my mother, Szilvia, for encouraging and supporting me. By listening while presenting the concepts, she helped me clarify my thoughts and improve this work. Last but not least, I would like to thank my grandfather P\'eter for all his incredible support and guidance, without whom I would not have gotten this far.
