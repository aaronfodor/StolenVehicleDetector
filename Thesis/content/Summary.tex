\chapter{Summary}

In my thesis, I discussed the general task of Automatic License Plate Recognition, then examined best practices for both Object Detection and Optical Character Recognition. I trained deep learning based models to detect number plates and recognize texts on them, then a full ALPR pipeline has been created. Then, I integrated my solution into a stolen vehicle identification system. In the end, I presented the key concepts of my system's frontend and backend applications.

Further work would focus on the license plate detection step, which could be optimized by using better models in detecting small objects like Ultralytic's YOLOv5\cite{YOLOv5}. Using a detector that recognizes rotated rectangular coordinates could eliminate the need for plate rectification (which the current pipeline lacks); therefore, using a WPOD-NET-like network should also be considered.
