\chapter{Object detection}

In this section, I discuss the work done related to object detection. In addition to the model development phases, I also describe the related research. Since deep learning requires a greater theoretical background, I assume knowledge of its general principles (backpropagation, convolutional neural networks) for reasons of length. I describe the theoretical background related to object detection in detail.
