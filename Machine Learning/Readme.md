# Machine Learning

This is the Machine Learning repository of the object detector. The model itself is based on a Convolutional Neural Network and built with TensorFlow Object Detection API. 



- The model building and training procedure can be found in the Model training Notebook. The Model inference file is used to run inference on the selected model. The TFlite converter Notebook does the Tensorflow -> tflite conversion.
- Find the data preparation process in /data subfolder. Note that the dataset itself is not uploaded due to its size, but image samples will be uploaded. A Power BI report is also accessible that visualizes the dataset.
