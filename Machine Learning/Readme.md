# Machine Learning

This is the Machine Learning repository of the object detector. The model itself is based on a Convolutional Neural Network and built with TensorFlow Object Detection API. 



- The model building and training procedure can be found in the Object detection Notebook, which is in the root directory.
- Find the data preparation process in /data subfolder. Note that the dataset itself is not uploaded due to its size, but image samples will be uploaded.
