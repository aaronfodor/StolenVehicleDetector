License plate generator pipeline:
•	Random text from allowed characters with a drawn length in the range of 1...20.
•	Select random font.
•	Set image type (RGB or grayscale) and colors.
•	Select random image background and text colors. The constraint is that the two colors must have at least 20% difference per channel.
•	Create the background and the transparent text images.
•	If the text is bigger than the background in any dimension, calculate a resize ratio to fit text onto the background.
•	Multiply resize ratio with a value in the resize text range (typically 0.85...1), then apply it to the text.
•	Set random text aspect ratio change.
•	Set random heigh, width offset of text on the background.
•	Set a random rotation with a value to fit text onto the background.
•	Apply random image enhancements: brightness, contrast, sharpness with drawn values; apply random gaussian blur.
•	Add overlay: pick an image, then random resize, rotation, placement on the generated image.
•	Set random resolution: downscale the image between a range, then scale it back (to degrade character resolution, but keep the required image dimensions).
