License plate generator pipeline:
-random text from allowed chars with random length in range
-random font
-set grayscale type & colors
-if RGB image is needed, set grayscale type & colors
-random image background and text colors
-create background image
-create text image
-if text image is bigger than background image in any dimension, calculate resize_ratio to fit text onto the background
-multiply resize_ratio with a value in resize_text range
-resize text image based on resize_ratio
-random text aspect ratio change with a value in text_aspect_ratio range
-random heigh, width offset of text on backgroud
-random rotation with a value in rotation_deg range
-random image enhancements: brightness, contrast, sharpness
-random gaussian blur
-dirt simulation: random dirt image, random resize, random rotation, random placement on plate image
-random image resolution: downscale image between range, then upscale back (to degradate character resolution, but keep required image dimensions)
