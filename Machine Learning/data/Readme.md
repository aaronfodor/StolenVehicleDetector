# Dataset

The dataset is based on the Google Open Images Dataset v6. It contains ~7k images with nearly 30k bounding boxes indicating Vehicle registration plates & Vehicles. 

- The full ETL process can be found in the *Dataset ETL* file.
- The *TFRecord inspector* notebook can show tfrecords as images with bounding boxes.

There are two subfolders in this repo: *report/* contains the Power BI analysis of the dataset, while *samples/* has a few images from the data visualized by TFRecord inspector*.
