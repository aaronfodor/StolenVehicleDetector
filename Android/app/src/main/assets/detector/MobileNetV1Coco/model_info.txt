Input: 
(1, 300, 300, 3), type: DT_FLOAT - channels_last RGB
quantized: 1 byte/channels/pixel [0, 255]

Output: 
HashMap<Int, Any>, type: DT_FLOAT - Use labelmap.txt to interpret output indices

The model outputs four arrays, mapped to the indices 0-4. Arrays 0, 1, and 2 describe 10 detected objects, with one element in each array corresponding to each object. There will always be 10 objects detected.

0:	detection_boxes
Multidimensional float32 tensor of shape [1, num_boxes, 4] with box locations. Floating point values between 0 and 1, the inner arrays representing bounding boxes in the form [top, left, bottom, right].

1:	detection_classes
A float32 tensor of shape [1, num_boxes] with class indices, each indicating the index of a class label from the labels file. 10 values.

2	detection_scores
A float32 tensor of shape [1, num_boxes] with class scores. Values between 0 and 1 representing probability that a class was detected. 10 values.

3	num_boxes	
float32 tensor of size 1 containing the number of detected boxes.
