File size: 4.086 MB
----------
Input: 
(300, 300, 3), type: DT_FLOAT - channels_last RGB
quantized: 1 byte/channels/pixel (from 0 to 255)
----------
Output: 
HashMap<Int, Any>, type: DT_FLOAT - Use labelmap.txt to interpret output indices

The model outputs four arrays, mapped to the indices 0-4. Arrays 0, 1, and 2 describe 10 detected objects, with one element in each array corresponding to each object. There will always be 10 objects detected.

0:	Locations	
Multidimensional array of [10][4] floating point values between 0 and 1, the inner arrays representing bounding boxes in the form [top, left, bottom, right]

1:	Classes		
Array of 10 integers (output as floating point values) each indicating the index of a class label from the labels file

2	Scores	
Array of 10 floating point values between 0 and 1 representing probability that a class was detected

3	Number and detections	
Array of length 1 containing a floating point value expressing the total number of detection results
